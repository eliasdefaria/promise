## Previewing Changes Locally

Run the following command at the root of your documentation where `mint.json` is
located. Promise will open at `localhost:3000`.

```bash Terminal
promise dev
```

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when working with the CLI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Promise is not loading">
    Update to Node v18 and the latest version of Git.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Promise is not loading after updating Node and Git">
    Run `promise install` and try again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Port 3000 is already taken">
    The Promise CLI will automatically move to the next port if you were already
    running something at `localhost:3000`. For example, if you were running two
    documentation sites, they would be at `localhost:3000` and `localhost:3001`.
